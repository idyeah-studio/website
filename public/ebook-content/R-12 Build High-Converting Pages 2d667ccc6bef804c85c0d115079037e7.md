🎯

**USE WHEN:**

You're redesigning a conversion-critical page (landing page, pricing page, sign-up flow, checkout) that has low conversion rates. Analytics show high bounce rates, form abandonment, or users viewing but not taking action. You need to redesign for persuasion and clarity.

⚠️

**THE CHALLENGE**

Conversion pages in existing applications often suffer from competing CTAs, unclear value propositions, trust issues, overwhelming choices, or buried key information. The page was designed by committee - every stakeholder added their "must-have" element, resulting in a cluttered mess that converts poorly. Users land on the page but don't understand the value, don't trust the offer, or don't know what action to take. You need to strip away distractions and design a focused conversion experience.

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

The AI will provide a value proposition framework with benefit-focused headlines and feature hierarchy, single primary CTA strategy with psychological button copy and visual prominence, trust-building elements including social proof and security badges, information hierarchy optimizing above-the-fold content with progressive disclosure, form optimization reducing fields to minimum viable with smart defaults and inline validation, mobile-specific optimizations for thumb-friendly placement and simplified forms, and A/B testing suggestions with hypothesis-driven variations. Optional annotated wireframe shows the high-converting layout.

**THE PROMPT BLUEPRINT**

```jsx
Act as a Conversion-Focused UX Designer specializing in high-converting page design.

I'm redesigning a [Page Type] that currently has a [Current Conversion Rate]% conversion rate and needs improvement.

[OPTIONAL: Attach screenshot of current page, analytics data showing drop-off points]

Current page problems:
- Conversion goal: [e.g., Sign up for free trial, Purchase product, Book demo, Download]
- Current issues: [e.g., Unclear value prop, too many CTAs, long form, no social proof]
- Analytics insights: [e.g., 70% bounce in first 5 seconds, form abandonment at step 2]
- User feedback: [e.g., "Don't understand what this does", "Seems expensive", "Too complicated"]

Page context:
- Target audience: [Who visits this page and why]
- Traffic source: [Paid ads, organic search, email, direct]
- User intent: [What problem are they trying to solve]
- Competition: [What alternatives do users consider]

Please provide:
1. Value proposition strategy (headline, subheadline, messaging hierarchy)
2. CTA optimization (primary action, copy, placement, design)
3. Trust elements and social proof placement
4. Information architecture (what to show, what to hide, visual hierarchy)
5. Friction reduction tactics (form optimization, objection handling)
6. Above-the-fold strategy
7. Mobile conversion optimization

Consider: [Constraints - e.g., Must include legal disclaimers, multiple pricing tiers, different user segments]
```

💡 What to customize:

- [Page Type] = Landing page, Pricing page, Sign-up flow, Checkout, Product page, Demo request
- [Current Conversion Rate] = Your actual conversion rate if known
- [Conversion goal] = Specific action you want users to take
- [Current issues] = Known problems from testing or analytics
- [Analytics insights] = Drop-off points, bounce rates, time on page
- [User feedback] = Actual quotes from user research
- Upload screenshot of current page for specific recommendations

**LIVE EXAMPLE**

```jsx
Act as a Conversion-Focused UX Designer specializing in high-converting page design.

I'm redesigning a SaaS Free Trial Sign-Up Page that currently has a 12% conversion rate (industry average is 25-35%) and needs improvement.

[User would attach screenshot here]

Current page problems:
- Conversion goal: Get users to start a 14-day free trial (no credit card required)
- Current issues: 
  - Headline says "Welcome" (generic, no value)
  - 8-field sign-up form visible immediately (first name, last name, email, password, confirm password, company name, company size, how did you hear about us)
  - Three CTAs competing: "Start Free Trial", "Watch Demo", "Talk to Sales"
  - No social proof or trust indicators
  - Features listed in small text below form (buried value props)
  - Legal disclaimer takes up 1/3 of screen
- Analytics insights: 
  - 65% bounce rate in first 10 seconds
  - Of those who start form, 45% abandon after entering email (when they see 6 more fields)
  - Mobile conversion is 3% (vs 15% desktop)
- User feedback: 
  - "Why do you need my company size to try the product?"
  - "Seems like a lot of work just to test it"
  - "I don't know what this tool does from this page"

Page context:
- Target audience: Marketing managers at 50-500 person companies looking for automation tools
- Traffic source: 60% Google Ads (high intent), 30% content marketing, 10% referrals
- User intent: Want to test if tool solves their specific automation problem before buying
- Competition: 5-6 similar tools, users compare features and ease of trial

Please provide:
1. Value proposition strategy (headline, subheadline, messaging hierarchy)
2. CTA optimization (primary action, copy, placement, design)
3. Trust elements and social proof placement
4. Information architecture (what to show, what to hide, visual hierarchy)
5. Friction reduction tactics (form optimization, objection handling)
6. Above-the-fold strategy
7. Mobile conversion optimization

Consider: Must collect email at minimum. Company size data is valuable for sales but not required for trial. Legal disclaimer is required but currently too prominent. High-intent users from ads convert better - should we show different pages based on traffic source?

**CHEF'S TIPS**

✦ Lead with value, not features: Users don't care about what you built, they care about what problem you solve
✦ Common mistake: Asking for information you don't immediately need - every form field kills ~10% of conversions
✦ Best with: Claude (excellent at persuasion psychology and copywriting), ChatGPT o1 (for complex multi-variant testing strategies)
✦ Remix it: "Now design 3 variations targeting: enterprise buyers, SMB buyers, and individual users"
✦ Pro move: Ask "Create an objection-handling map: for each common concern, where and how do we address it?"

**FOLLOW-UP PROMPTS**

- "Write 5 headline variations using different psychological triggers (urgency, social proof, benefit, curiosity, authority)"
- "Design the post-conversion thank you page that maximizes next-step engagement"
- "What exit-intent popup should we show to users who try to leave without converting?"
- "Create an A/B test roadmap: which elements to test first for biggest conversion lift"
