🎯

**USE WHEN:**

You're redesigning an interface that looks generic and forgettable - it could belong to any company, lacks distinctive visual personality, or feels like a template with your logo slapped on. You want to create memorable, ownable design elements that differentiate your product.

⚠️

**THE CHALLENGE**

Many applications look identical - same rounded corners, same shadows, same color schemes, same button styles. They use off-the-shelf component libraries (Material Design, Bootstrap, Tailwind defaults) without customization, resulting in interfaces that are functional but forgettable. Users can't distinguish your product from competitors. There's no visual signature that says "this is us." You need to identify and design distinctive visual hooks - unique patterns, shapes, interactions, or treatments that become synonymous with your brand and make your interface instantly recognizable.

**THE PROMPT BLUEPRINT**

```jsx
Act as a Brand-Focused UX Designer specializing in creating distinctive, memorable interface patterns.

I'm creating a unique visual identity for a [Product Type] in the [Industry] space.

[OPTIONAL: Attach brand guidelines, competitor screenshots, current interface]

Brand and product context:
- Brand personality: [e.g., Bold and confident, Playful and friendly, Sophisticated and minimal, Warm and human]
- Unique value proposition: [What makes your product different from competitors]
- Target audience: [Who uses this, their preferences and expectations]
- Competitors: [Main competitors and their visual approaches]
- Current visual state: [Generic template, borrowed patterns, no distinctive elements]

Opportunities for uniqueness:
- [Opportunity 1: e.g., Our product is about connection - could use connecting lines/threads as motif]
- [Opportunity 2: e.g., Brand uses organic shapes - could apply to UI components]
- [Opportunity 3: e.g., Product name relates to speed - could use motion/velocity in design]

Current problems:
- [Problem 1: e.g., Interface looks like every other SaaS app - indistinguishable]
- [Problem 2: e.g., Using default Material Design - no customization]
- [Problem 3: e.g., Nothing memorable - users can't describe our interface to others]

Please provide:
1. Visual hook opportunities (distinctive patterns to own)
2. Shape language and geometry
3. Unique interaction patterns
4. Signature color treatment
5. Distinctive typography usage
6. Memorable micro-details
7. Consistency guidelines (when to use hooks, when not to)
8. Examples of successful visual hooks from other products

Consider: [Constraints - e.g., Must remain professional, can't be too quirky, needs to scale across product, accessibility requirements, technical feasibility]
```

💡 What to customize:

- [Product Type] = SaaS platform, Mobile app, Design tool, E-commerce, Productivity app
- [Industry] = Your market space and competitive landscape
- [Brand personality] = Your brand's distinctive character
- [Unique value proposition] = What makes you different
- [Opportunities] = Ideas based on brand/product
- [Problems 1-3] = Current generic design issues
- Upload competitor interfaces and your current design for comparison

**LIVE EXAMPLE**

```jsx
Act as a Brand-Focused UX Designer specializing in creating distinctive, memorable interface patterns.

I'm creating a unique visual identity for a Team Collaboration Platform in the crowded project management space.

[User would attach screenshots here]

Brand and product context:
- Brand personality: Warm and human, approachable but professional, emphasizes human connection over productivity metrics, friendly without being childish
- Unique value proposition: Unlike task-focused competitors (Asana, Monday), we emphasize team relationships and communication - "work with people, not just tasks"
- Target audience: Remote teams (10-50 people), creative agencies, startups valuing culture, ages 25-40, design-conscious users
- Competitors: 
  - Asana: Purple, clean, geometric, very structured
  - Monday: Colorful, playful, lots of colors and emojis
  - Linear: Dark, precise, technical, developer-focused
  - Notion: Minimal, neutral, very flexible
- Current visual state: Using Tailwind defaults with slight color tweaks - rounded-lg corners (8px), default shadows, standard blues and grays, looks like every other SaaS app

Opportunities for uniqueness:
- Our product is about human connection - could use connecting lines, threads, or relationship metaphors as recurring visual motif
- Brand name "Tether" suggests connection and bonds - opportunity for linked/tethered visual elements
- We emphasize warmth - could use warmer color palette (peach, coral, warm grays) instead of cold blues
- Product focuses on async communication - could visualize time zones, handoffs, message threads in distinctive ways
- Team avatars are central - could make them more prominent, overlapping, connected visually

Current problems:
- Interface looks exactly like Notion + Linear had a baby - completely generic
- Using default rounded corners (8px) like everyone else - Asana, Notion, Monday all use similar radii
- Standard shadow system copied from Tailwind - nothing distinctive
- Color palette is "safe" blue/gray - forgettable and corporate
- Button styles, form inputs, cards all look like template components
- No visual element that users could describe: "Oh yeah, that's the app with the [distinctive thing]"

Please provide:
1. Visual hook opportunities (distinctive patterns to own)
2. Shape language and geometry
3. Unique interaction patterns
4. Signature color treatment
5. Distinctive typography usage
6. Memorable micro-details
7. Consistency guidelines (when to use hooks, when not to)
8. Examples of successful visual hooks from other products

Consider: Must remain professional for enterprise sales (can't be too playful or quirky). Design-conscious users will judge visual sophistication. Need to scale across web, mobile, and future integrations. Accessibility contrast requirements. Technical team prefers CSS-based solutions over complex illustrations.

**CHEF'S TIPS**

✦ Own one thing completely: Better to have one distinctive element done perfectly than five half-baked ideas
✦ Common mistake: Adding quirks for the sake of being different - hooks must serve the brand story
✦ Best with: Claude (excellent at brand-aligned creative thinking), ChatGPT (good for visual inspiration)
✦ Remix it: "Design the signature empty state - the moment when users see our personality shine"
✦ Pro move: Ask "Create the visual hook evolution roadmap - start subtle, add more over 6 months"
