🎯

**USE WHEN:**

You're redesigning landing page hero sections that aren't converting - vague value propositions, weak headlines, unclear CTAs, or visitors bounce without understanding what you offer. The hero section exists but doesn't compel users to take action.

⚠️

**THE CHALLENGE**

Many applications have weak hero sections - generic headlines ("Welcome to our platform"), vague descriptions that could apply to any competitor, no clear value proposition, weak or multiple competing CTAs, poor visual hierarchy, stock photos that don't show the product, and no social proof or trust signals. Visitors land on the page, don't understand what you do or why they should care, and leave within 5 seconds. The hero section wastes prime real estate with platitudes instead of compelling value. You need hero sections that immediately communicate what you do, for whom, and why it matters - driving visitors to convert.

**WHAT TO EXPECT**

The AI will provide benefit-driven headline formulas with specific structure and examples (6-12 words addressing pain points), subheadline strategy expanding on the headline with clear CTA hierarchy featuring one prominent primary action, visual content recommendations using actual product screenshots instead of stock photos with annotations highlighting key features, trust signals including customer logos and metrics positioned above the fold, responsive layout structures for desktop (split or centered) and mobile optimization with shorter headlines and stacked elements, and A/B testing recommendations for headlines, CTAs, visuals, and social proof placement. Optionally includes hero section mockups with variations.

**THE PROMPT BLUEPRINT**

```jsx
Act as a Conversion-Focused Designer specializing in landing pages, hero sections, and value proposition design.

I'm designing a hero section for a [Product Type] targeting [Target Audience] to increase [Conversion Goal].

[OPTIONAL: Attach screenshots of current hero section or competitor examples]

Hero section requirements:
- Product/service: [e.g., Project management tool, E-commerce platform, SaaS analytics]
- Target audience: [e.g., Small business owners, Developers, Marketing teams, Consumers]
- Key differentiator: [e.g., Simplicity, Speed, AI-powered, All-in-one, Affordable]
- Conversion goal: [e.g., Sign up for trial, Book demo, Make purchase, Download app]
- Traffic source: [e.g., Google Ads, Social media, Direct, Referrals]

Current hero problems:
- [Problem 1: e.g., Headline is generic "Welcome to our platform" - says nothing about value]
- [Problem 2: e.g., Description is vague "We help you work better" - doesn't explain how]
- [Problem 3: e.g., Three CTAs compete: "Learn More", "Get Started", "Watch Video" - unclear priority]
- [Problem 4: e.g., Stock photo of people in office - doesn't show product]
- [Problem 5: e.g., No social proof - visitors don't trust unknown brand]

User context: [Why visitors come, what they're looking for, pain points]

Please provide:
1. Headline formula (clear, benefit-driven, specific)
2. Subheadline/description strategy
3. CTA design and hierarchy (primary, secondary)
4. Visual content (product screenshots, demo, video)
5. Trust signals and social proof
6. Above-the-fold layout
7. Mobile hero optimization
8. A/B testing recommendations

Consider: [Constraints - e.g., Must work on mobile, need to appeal to technical and non-technical users, competitive market, limited brand recognition]
```

💡 What to customize:

- [Product Type] = Your product or service
- [Target Audience] = Who you're trying to convert
- [Conversion Goal] = Specific action you want
- [Key differentiator] = What makes you unique
- [Traffic source] = Where visitors come from
- [Problems 1-5] = Current hero section weaknesses
- Upload current hero section or competitor examples

**LIVE EXAMPLE**

```jsx
Act as a Conversion-Focused Designer specializing in landing pages, hero sections, and value proposition design.

I'm designing a hero section for a Team Communication Platform targeting remote teams to increase free trial signups.

[User would attach hero screenshots here]

Hero section requirements:
- Product/service: Team communication platform (chat, video calls, file sharing, integrations)
- Target audience: 
  - Remote teams (5-50 people)
  - Startups and small businesses
  - Team leads and managers (decision makers)
  - Tech-savvy but not developers
- Key differentiator: 
  - Simpler than Slack (less overwhelming)
  - More affordable than Microsoft Teams
  - Built specifically for remote teams (async-first)
  - Beautiful, modern interface
- Conversion goal: Start free 14-day trial (no credit card required)
- Traffic source: 
  - Google Ads (40%): Searching "slack alternative", "team chat"
  - Product Hunt / Reddit (30%): Tech-savvy early adopters
  - Social media (20%): LinkedIn, Twitter referrals
  - Direct (10%): Word of mouth, returning visitors

Current hero problems:
- Headline "Welcome to TeamChat" is generic - says nothing about what we do or why we're different (could be any chat app)
- Subheadline "The modern way to communicate with your team" is vague - doesn't explain how we're different from 20 competitors
- Three competing CTAs at same visual weight: "Start Free Trial" (primary), "Watch Demo" (video), "See Pricing" - visitors don't know which to click first
- Hero image is stock photo of diverse people smiling in video call - doesn't show our actual product interface
- No social proof visible above fold - visitors don't see "10,000+ teams trust us" or customer logos
- Headline is same on mobile and desktop - doesn't optimize for smaller screens
- No mention of "free" or "no credit card" - friction point for trial signups
- Subheadline is 3 lines on mobile - too long, visitors don't read it

User context: Visitors are currently using Slack or Microsoft Teams but frustrated (too complex, too expensive, too many features they don't need). They're searching for simpler alternatives. Budget-conscious - need to justify expense to leadership. Remote teams need async communication (not everyone online at same time). Decision makers compare 3-5 tools before choosing. Trust is critical - won't sign up without seeing social proof. Mobile traffic 35% (managers checking on phones).

Please provide:
1. Headline formula (clear, benefit-driven, specific)
2. Subheadline/description strategy
3. CTA design and hierarchy (primary, secondary)
4. Visual content (product screenshots, demo, video)
5. Trust signals and social proof
6. Above-the-fold layout
7. Mobile hero optimization
8. A/B testing recommendations

Consider: Must communicate "simpler than Slack" immediately. Headline should include main benefit. Show actual product (not stock photos). Social proof critical for unknown brand. Mobile hero needs shorter copy. Free trial CTA must be prominent. Address main objection: "Is this just another Slack clone?" Conversion rate currently 2.8%, industry average 5-8% for free trial signups.

**CHEF'S TIPS**

✦ Headline is everything: Spend 80% of effort on headline - it's what 80% of visitors read
✦ Common mistake: Multiple competing CTAs - choose ONE primary action, make it obvious
✦ Best with: Claude (excellent at value proposition clarity), ChatGPT (good for headline variations)
✦ Remix it: "Design the hero video - 30-second product demo that plays in hero background"
✦ Pro move: Ask "Generate 10 headline variations to A/B test - benefit-driven, specific, differentiated"

- "Create the trust signal strategy - where to place logos, testimonials, metrics for maximum credibility"
- "How should the hero section adapt for different traffic sources (ads vs organic vs referral)?"
